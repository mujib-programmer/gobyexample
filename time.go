// Go offers extensive support for times and durations; here are some examples.
package main

import "fmt"
import "time"

func main() {
	p := fmt.Println

	// Weâ€™ll start by getting the current time.
	now := time.Now()
	p(now)

	// You can build a time struct by providing the year, month, day, etc.
	// Times are always associated with a Location, i.e. time zone.
	then := time.Date(
		2009, 11, 17, 20, 34, 58, 651387237, time.UTC)
	p(then)

	// You can extract the various components of the time value as expected.
	p(then.Year())
	p(then.Month())
	p(then.Day())
	p(then.Hour())
	p(then.Minute())
	p(then.Second())
	p(then.Nanosecond())
	p(then.Location())

	// The Monday-Sunday Weekday is also available.
	p(then.Weekday())

	// These methods compare two times, testing if the first occurs before, after, or at the same time as the second, respectively.
	p(then.Before(now))
	p(then.After(now))
	p(then.Equal(now))

	// The sub methods returns a Duration representing the interval between two times.
	diff := now.Sub(then)
	p(diff)

	// We can compute the length of the duration in various units.
	p(diff.Hours())
	p(diff.Minutes())
	p(diff.Seconds())
	p(diff.Nanoseconds())

	// You can use Add to advance a time by a given duration, or with a - to move backwards by a duration
	p(then.Add(diff))
	p(then.Add(-diff))
